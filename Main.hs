{-
 - You can compile this program by entering 'ghc Main.hs' in the command line
 - and you can run the resulting executable 'Main' by entering './Main'
 -
 - Do that, then ...
 -
 -
 - Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
 - is to make this program print a hilarious, hilarious joke
 -
 - instead of just the word 'here'.
 -
 - And if you want an additional challenge, have it print all the nonnegative
 - integers less than 100
 -
 - may the force be with you
